## Geoff Boeing
> Geoff has some truely amazing work on his [blog](https://geoffboeing.com/publications/), were he talks about urban planning, his 
[OSMnx library]() which describes the methods for acquiring, constructing, analyzing, and visualizing complex street 
networks(using networkX and other spatial data from OpenStreetMap)
### Data
- He also shares some great data sets on [harvards dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CUWWYJ) which contains over 110,000 processed, cleaned street network graphs (which in turn comprise over 55 million nodes and over 137 million edges) at various scalesâ€”comprehensively covering the entire U.S.
