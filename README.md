# Alice's Restaurant

## Welcome to my junkpile!

Some people call me a data hoarder(maybe its just me), I love data of all types, and I have a hard time not wanting to be able to find it in the future. this is my feeble to try to organize, code, data set, notebooks, colab notebooks, and my favorite websites.

It is important that you keep in mind this is just a junk pile, I may organize it from time to time, but for the most part, it is just a 
junk pile. 

## I am looking for a better way to store all the links/code/concepts/notebooks/projects

I don't know if this is going to work but I am going to try to use the EFELS modified cresp-dm model to organize my junk pile 

### EFELS MODIFIED CRISP-DM (DR. Scummer)

Define, research, sutup, clean, understand, munge, model, evaluate, report/refine

- Define - what they want, what you have, what you want, what success looks like.
- Research - what work has been done on the topic of interest, what other resources/data do you want to have/get/make so that you get 
the best outcome.
- Setup - computer/env/lib/stack/tool/DB setup
- Clean - clean it/shape it so you can understand it
- Understand - EDA
- munge - transforming/mapping/feature engineering
- model - run models
- evaluate - yep
- report/refine - you like


#### STAGE ONE – DETERMINE BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
Uncover important factors that could influence the outcome of the project. (Set objectives, produce project plan Business success criteria)
Assess the current situation -
Available resources, requirements, assumptions, constraints, risks contingencies, terminology overview(relevant business terminology and concepts), review project costs and benefits.
Determine goals - Business and project success criteria 
Produce a project plan

#### STAGE TWO – DATA UNDERSTANDING
- Describe data - what you have, what you want
- Data sources
- open source datasets
- webscraping
- available databases
- Initial data collection report
- Data description report
- EDA(exploratory data analysis)
- Distribution of key attributes (for example, the target attribute of a prediction task)
- Relationships between pairs or small numbers of attributes
- Results of simple aggregations
- Properties of significant sub-populations
- Simple statistical analyses
- Visualization
- Data exploration report 
- Verify data quality
- Data quality report

#### STAGE THREE – DATA PREPARATION
- Data selection- rationale for inclusion/exclusion
- Clean your data
- Data cleaning report
- labeling
- clustering
- embedding
- Data formatting
- Data cleaning
- Data anonymization
- Data sampling
- Data transformations
- Scaling
- Decomposition
- Aggregation
- Feature creation
- binning
#### STAGE FOUR – MODELLING
- Select modeling technique
- Modeling technique
- Modeling assumptions
- Generate test design
- training set, test set, validation set
- Build model
- Parameter settings
- Models
- Model descriptions
- Assess model
- Model assessment
- Revised parameter settings
#### STAGE FIVE – MODEL EVALUATION
- model evaluation and testing
- cross-validation
- ensemble models
- stacking
- bagging(bootstrap aggregating)
- boosting
#### STAGE SIX - MODEL REFINEMENT
- Parameter Tuning
#### STAGE SEVEN - MODEL PRESENTATION

#### STAGE EIGHT - PRODUCTION
- Batch prediction
- Web service
- Real-time prediction(real-time streaming or hot path)
- Stream learning
